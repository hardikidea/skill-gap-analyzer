Their design is influenced by and influences other designs and must be conform with these designs and the overall artistic vision. Therefore, the pyrotechnic designers work closely with artistic directors, operators and the artistic team. During rehearsals and performance they coach the operators to obtain optimal timing and manipulation. Pyrotechnic designers develop plans, cue lists and other documentation to support the operators and production crew. Pyrotechnic designers sometimes also work as autonomous artists, creating pyrotechnical art outside a performance context.",
